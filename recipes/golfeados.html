    <h2>Description</h2>
     
      <p>Golfeados are a Venezuelan pastry. It's in effect their version of sticky buns but with a 
        couple of distinct twists. The filling is not just butter and sugar, there's also cheese 
        in there. Plus, these sweet rolls are usually flavored with anise. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>500 g all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>7 g active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup warm milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup panela (or brown sugar), grated</li>
      <li>1 tbsp ground anise seeds</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated white cheese (queso llanero or feta as substitute)</li>
      <li>Butter for spreading (softened)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Glaze</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup panela (or brown sugar)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup water</li>
      <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
      <li>Optional: pinch of cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a small bowl, mix warm water, warm milk, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 10 minutes until it becomes foamy.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Add the egg, melted butter, and the yeast mixture. Mix and knead until a smooth dough forms (about 10 minutes).</li>
      <li>Cover the dough with a clean towel and let it rise in a warm place for 1 to 1.5 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
      <li>On a floured surface, roll the dough into a rectangle about 0.5 cm (1/4 inch) thick.</li>
      <li>Spread softened butter evenly over the dough. Sprinkle grated panela (or brown sugar), ground anise seeds, and grated cheese on top.</li>
      <li>Roll the dough tightly into a log, starting from the long side. Cut into even slices about 3–4 cm wide.</li>
      <li>Place the slices cut-side up on a greased baking tray, leaving space between them. Let them rest for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
      <li>Bake the golfeados for 25–30 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, prepare the glaze by heating panela, water, and butter in a saucepan until it forms a syrup. Add cinnamon if desired.</li>
      <li>As soon as the golfeados come out of the oven, brush them generously with the syrup.</li>
      <li>Let them cool slightly and serve warm. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
