  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tequeños are a popular Venezuelan snack made of cheese sticks wrapped in a soft dough and then 
      fried until golden and crispy. They are often served as appetizers at parties, celebrations, or 
      as a street food treat. The cheese inside is typically a salty white cheese that melts well, 
      such as queso blanco or queso llanero. Tequeños are beloved for their crunchy exterior and gooey, 
      savory center, and they’re commonly enjoyed with dips like guasacaca (a type of avocado sauce) or 
      sweet sauces like papelón syrup</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
  <h3>Dough</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Filling</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>250 g (about 1/2 lb) firm white cheese (queso blanco, queso llanero, or mozzarella), cut into sticks</li>

    <li>Cut the dough into long strips (about 1.5 cm wide).</li>
